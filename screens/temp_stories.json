        "story": "A Shepherd Boy tended his master's Sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe.\n\nOne day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself.\n\nHis Master had told him to call for help should a Wolf attack the flock, and the Villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, 'Wolf! Wolf!'\n\nAs he expected, the Villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there they found the Boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them.A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, 'Wolf! Wolf!' Again the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again.\n\nThen one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did spring from the underbrush and fall upon the Sheep.\n\nIn terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting 'Wolf! Wolf!' But though the Villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. 'He cannot fool us again,' they said.\n\nThe Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.",

        "story": "A Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the Bull's pardon for having used his horn for a resting place.\n\n'You must be very glad to have me go now,' he said.\n\n'It's all the same to me,' replied the Bull. 'I did not even know you were there.'",
        "moral": "We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit."
